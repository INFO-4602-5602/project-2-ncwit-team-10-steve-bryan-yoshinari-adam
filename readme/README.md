# Information about Visualizaiton
1. Demographics of female tech-related major students changed over time.
1. Which institution is doing well on retaining female tech-related students.
1. Is admission ratio biased by gender revealed through GPA/ACT score?

## Why choosing these representaions
1. Multi-line graph to see the change
1. Stacked bar graph with percentage of students left the school, switched majors, and stayed in the same major.

# What Each Vis Shows

Vis 1 -- Racial demographic change over a five year period. WE chose institutions that had complete data over the years displayed. The interaction allows selection between races. This was chosen in order to reduce visual clutter, or a "spaghetti" plot.

Vis 2 -- We picked the year 2015 and then summed all values within the institution regarding students staying in their major, switching majors, or leaving their institution. The interaction allows for separation between genders to see if there is a gender-based difference in retention.

Vis 3 -- Using ACT scores and GPA as a quantifiable metric, we examined the difference in enrollment rates between the genders. In this variation on a scatter plot, we plot institutions for both the female and male quantifiable metric (ex ACT score) connected by a line segment. The line segment allows for quick understanding of the disparity between scores and how admissions are biased. The y-axis is in terms of female enrollment percent, because the male enrollment percent can be inferred from the female enrollment percent.

# Design Process
* Initial sketching by a pen and a sheet of paper.
* Prototype visualization by Tableau and finding out the problem of the imbalance between races (i.e., more Asian female students than White female students)
* Do we have the clean data for our visualization purpose
* Different restrictions by years (to see if we have enough data to plot)
* Whether the visualization is clean enough to interpret or not.
* Validity of the resulting visualization or not (confusing or not).
