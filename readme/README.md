# Design Process
* Initial sketching by a pen and a sheet of paper.
* Prototype visualization by Tableau and finding out the problem of the imbalance between races (i.e., more Asian female students than White female students)
* Do we have the clean data for our visualization purpose
* Different restrictions by years (to see if we have enough data to plot)
* Whether the visualization is clean enough to interpret or not. 
* Validity of the resulting visualization or not (confusing or not).

# Team Roles
All team members contributed to what visuzliation we want.
* Adam: Massive data cleaning
* Steve: D3 visualizations, data cleaning
* Bryan: Data checking, giving ideas
* Yoshinari: Other random work
